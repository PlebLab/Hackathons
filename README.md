# PlebLab_Hackathons

At PlebLab, we are committed to fostering innovation, cultivating communities, and supporting the growth of the Lightning Network through our annual hackathons. Each year, we organize and power a few hackathons that bring together developers, makers, and entrepreneurs to push the boundaries of what is possible with Bitcoin.

Our hackathons feature a range of workshops and categories designed to suit the needs and interests of our attendees. We are proud to have an engaged and passionate community of the next generation of Bitcoin builders, developers, and leaders dedicated to advancing the technology and driving its adoption.

At PlebLab, we have always been a community-first, mission-driven organization. We are committed to maintaining this ethos and continuing to support the growth and development of the Lightning Network through our hackathons and other initiatives.
